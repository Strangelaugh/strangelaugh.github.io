    <h2>Projects I'm interested in:</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <dl>
          <dt>Functional implementation of the Trusted
      Platform Module (preferably in OCaml/Coq or F#/F*)</dt>
          <dd>The TPM specification is written in (sometimes bad) C
      code.</dd>
          <dd>Functional languages are considered safer in general and
      often produce produce less buggy code.</dd>
          <dd>At least the TPM specification should be as close to bug
      free as possible.</dd>
          <dd>Virtual TPMs are often used as virtual security modules
      and would greatly benefit from a secure implementation even if
      hardware vendors ultimately need C code.</dd>
          <dd>A functional specification would make it far more
      amenable to formal verification than the current one.</dd>
        </dl>
      </li>
      <li>
      <dl>
      <dt>... a verifiable model and specification of the TPM.</dt>
      <dd>Operating systems, compilers, and entire distributed
      systems are formally verified--yet the TPM
      isn't...</dd>
      <dd>Inspired by current RISC-V work, developing a practical
      verification framework for TPM would be challenging, interesting, and
      could uncover a variety of bugs.</dd>
      <dd>This would also allow meaningful simulation and evaluation of trusted computing protocols in the evolving virtualization space.</dd>
      </dl>
      </li>
      <li>
      <dl>
      <dt>Implementing virtual TPMs using MirageOS</dt>
      <dd>Unikernels on Xen provide a much smaller TCB compared to
      solutions implementing vTPMs as processes of a full OS.</dd>
      <dd>Current research shows that such micro VMs can be launched
      with fork-like speeds.</dd>
      <dd>Naturally improved and hardware supported isolation compared
      to vTPMs as processes on anything that isn't a microkernel.</dd>
      </dl>
      </li>
      <li>
      <dl>
      <dt>Verifying complex (and trusted) systems on an architecture
      level at scale (Bigraphs are particularly interesting).</dt>
      <dd>Formal verification remains notoriously time consuming and
      expensive.</dd>
      <dd>Most trusted computing systems can be specified on an
      architecture level (does not mean that code verification can be
      skipped).</dd>
      <dd>Verifying security properties of trusted computing systems
      aids system design and guides verification effort and can be
      less expensive.</dd>
      <dd>Many interesting frameworks available, no clear winners yet.</dd>
      </dl>
      </li>
      <li>
      <dl>
      <dt>TPM out of nothing (or with less...)</dt>
      <dd>Secure co-processors and well isolated execution
      environments are provably secure against a variety of software/hardware attacks.</dd>
      <dd>Extra hardware can be expensive, slow, and unavailable.</dd>
      <dd>The goal is to implement equivalent functionality while reducing the amount of extra hardware need.</dd>
      </dl>
